****CROSS GAMING ARENA****
## MORINGA PHASE 1 PROJECT
## Github Pages Link: https://njugunaaa.github.io/cross-Gaming-Arena/ 
## A GAME BOOKING APPLICATION
=> This application allows users to browse, book and add games to their booking catalog in the 
server and goes on to fetch, add and update data in the server momentarily altogether.


## Technologies used
=> HTML -For structuring my app
=> CSS -Styling my app
=> JavaScript -Handled application functionality and api interaction.
=> JSONBin.io - Storing and retrieval of my data
## How it works
## One is able to see what games are available and on hovering over the various game posters a user can be able 
to see which games are available and if they are booked who they are booked by and or what duration.
=> A user is able to book and when they submit the booking it is automatically updated in the server and can still 
be displayable on hover on the game poster.
=> The user can also be able to add games they wish to also play and are not available which can be posted on the UI
and can be validated and maybe incorporated by the gaming employees.
=> Very insightful project.
## NB: I also added my initial localhost script.js file here for reference as well.
